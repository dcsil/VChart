# Team Principles

## **Communication**
- **Primary Platform**: Our team will communicate primarily through Discord, utilizing its various features to streamline collaboration.
- **Channels**:  
  - `#general`: For announcements, team-wide updates, and general communication.  
  - `#business`: For discussions and updates specific to CSC454 (business-side deliverables).  
  - `#technical`: For discussions and updates specific to CSC491 (technical-side deliverables).  
  - `#tasks`: For tracking progress, task delegation, and status updates.  
  - `#emergency`: A dedicated channel for urgent matters.
- **Calls**: Discord's voice and video call features will be used for meetings and discussions when more efficient than text communication.
- **Responsibility**:  
  - Specific questions should tag the relevant team members in the appropriate channel for quicker responses.  
  - General questions can be posted in `#general` for the whole group.  
  - Acknowledge important questions and updates with reactions (e.g., üëç/üëé).
- **Expectations**:  
  - Check Discord channels daily (Monday to Friday).  
  - If you are unable to check for more than 24 hours, notify the team in advance so expectations are managed.  
- **Emergency Communication**: In urgent situations, team members' contact numbers will be collected and pinned in the `#emergency` channel for direct texting or calling. This method is reserved for emergencies only.  
- **Culture**: Promote a supportive, cooperative, and blameless environment where everyone works as a cohesive team toward shared goals.

## **Meetings**
- **Regular Meetings**:  
  - We will hold weekly team meetings, with additional meetings scheduled as needed.  
  - Meetings will address both CSC454 (business-side) and CSC491 (technical-side) deliverables.  
  - We will ensure meeting times accommodate everyone's schedules as best as possible.  
- **Attendance**:  
  - Notify the team as early as possible if you cannot attend a meeting.  
  - If absent, arrange for someone to share your updates.  
  - Catch up on meeting notes and ensure you are up to date on action items.  
- **Documentation**: Meeting minutes will be shared in the Discord channel and archived for reference.

## **Work Allocation**
- **Task Delegation**:  
  - Tasks will be assigned during meetings, balancing workload among members and accounting for differences in CSC454 and CSC491 deliverables.  
  - Assignments and progress will be tracked via GitHub Issues and a kanban board.  
- **Collaboration and Support**:  
  - If a task becomes too challenging or time-consuming, notify the team so others can assist.  
  - Support each other across both technical and business components, recognizing that the courses have overlapping goals.  
- **Deadlines and Reviews**:  
  - Complete tasks with sufficient time for peer review and team discussions.  
  - Use GitHub pull requests and comments to facilitate collaborative reviews.  
  - Avoid last-minute submissions to ensure quality and team input.

## **Conflict Resolution**
- If disagreements arise, they will be addressed collaboratively through open and respectful discussions.
- In case of unresolved conflicts, we will escalate issues to the course instructors for guidance.

## **Other Considerations**
- **Unforeseen Challenges**: While not every issue can be predicted, we are committed to finding solutions through clear communication and teamwork.
- **Cross-Course Coordination**:  
  - Members enrolled in both CSC454 and CSC491 will ensure that information relevant to both courses is shared with the entire team.  
  - We will identify overlapping components between courses and work collaboratively to optimize efforts.  

By adhering to these principles, we aim to maintain a productive, respectful, and effective team dynamic throughout the project.
