# Diversity at VChart

VChart is an EMR charting software designed to support nurses across North America. Recognizing the rich cultural and racial diversity within this region, we acknowledge the value of building a diverse and inclusive team. To ensure we meet the needs of our diverse user base, we are committed to identifying our strengths and areas for improvement while exploring effective strategies to address any gaps.

## Backgrounds and Expertise (Strengths)

Our team is composed of diverse gender backgrounds, including two female and three male members, and people from more than one culture. This aligns well with the potential backgrounds of our users (nurses) and their patients. Additionally, our members have a wide range of educational levels, including undergraduate, master’s, and PhD students. This diversity allows us to approach problems from multiple angles, combining practical and research-driven insights to build effective solutions.

Our development team is highly skilled and well-rounded in technical expertise. Both members are proficient in full-stack development, enabling flexible task allocation and seamless collaboration within the team. In addition:
- **Eric** brings extensive experience in AI research and integrating LLMs into applications, providing a strong foundation for the AI aspects of our work.  
- **Khushi** has extensive experience in software engineering, specializing in AI-based systems, full-stack development, and accessible design.

## Backgrounds and Expertise (Weaknesses)

None of our team members have direct experience with medical software. As a result, we would need to consult professionals to ensure that our application, particularly in terms of use cases and privacy compliance, aligns with industry standards. Additionally, we would need to conduct thorough research on existing products to identify key features that should be implemented.

Although our team is entirely Asian, some members raised in Canada provide a broader perspective. To ensure cultural relevance in North American markets, we will actively seek feedback from diverse user groups and experts. Our team also lacks diversity in terms of sexuality, sexual orientation, religion, and disability. To ensure inclusivity, we would need to carefully consider the needs and requirements of these populations so that our medical forms include all necessary options.

Furthermore, none of us have experience developing a B2B startup, so we will need to learn and seek guidance from instructors and industry professionals to ensure we stay on the right track. Additionally, we are aware that our medical software must comply with rigorous regulations. However, since none of us are familiar with the legal aspects, we will need to conduct thorough research and consult experts to address this gap.

## Where the Team Lacks Diversity

Our team lacks diversity in several areas, which could impact the perspectives we bring to the company, team, and product. First of all, none of our members have direct experience in the healthcare industry, limiting our first-hand insights into its operations. Additionally, our team is composed entirely of Asian members, with no representation from white or other cultural backgrounds, which might affect our cultural understanding of markets like the US and Canada. We also lack diversity in terms of non-binary gender identities, sexuality, and disability, which could result in overlooking the needs of these populations. Finally, our team also lacks socioeconomic diversity, as all our members come from middle-class backgrounds. This is an important factor to consider when designing requirements for our forms. For example, individuals from lower-income backgrounds may face challenges such as lacking insurance, official documents, or even phone numbers. We need to ensure that our forms are inclusive and flexible to accommodate these circumstances.

### To address this, we will:
- Conduct interviews and usability testing with diverse populations to ensure inclusivity in product design.
- Partner with advisors and professionals from varied cultural and demographic backgrounds.
- Incorporate accessibility guidelines and best practices to cater to users with disabilities.
