# Use Cases

- MVP:

  1. AI-Powered Auto-Save Voice Charting (Hands-Free Documentation)

  - Nurses don’t have time to manually type notes or review transcriptions between patients. VChart allows them to record their observations via voice input, and the system automatically transcribes and charts the information in real time.

  - Steps

    1. Nurse opens the web app on mobile between patients.
    2. Selects a patient profile from the list.
    3. Nurse initiates a new entry.
    4. Taps the voice recording button and speaks.
    5. AI transcribes speech in real time and immediately saves the structured chart entry to the system.
    6. The entry is marked as pending review for later edits.

  2. Quick Chart Review and Editing on a Computer

  - Since voice-charted entries are auto-saved in real time, nurses must later review and finalize them. VChart allows nurses or supervisors to edit AI-generated charts in under 30 seconds from a desktop interface.

  - Steps

    1.  Nurse logs into the VChart web app.
    2.  Navigates to the “Pending Review” chart entries.
    3.  Selects a patient chart to review.
    4.  Reads the AI-generated chart entry.
    5.  Makes quick edits if necessary.
    6.  Exports to PDF/email

  3. Manage Patient List

  - Nurses need to dynamically manage their patient list to reflect the patients they are currently attending to. This includes adding new patients and removing those who are no longer under their care.

  - Steps

    1.  Nurse logs into the VChart web app.
    2.  Adds a new patient by filling in essential information such as name, room number, and any other relevant details.
    3.  Identifies and removes patients from the list who are no longer under their care.

  4. HIPAA Compliance and Data Security

  - VChart ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information (PHI) by implementing robust security measures and adhering to HIPAA guidelines.

- Post-MVP:

  1. Integrate with existing EHRs

  - VChart will integrate with EHRs to allow nurses to chart directly from the EHR.
