# Use Cases

1. AI-Powered Auto-Save Voice Charting (Hands-Free Documentation)

- Nurses don’t have time to manually type notes or review transcriptions between patients. VChart allows them to record their observations via voice input, and the system automatically transcribes and charts the information in real time, without requiring manual review at that moment.

- Steps

  1. Nurse opens the web app on mobile between patients.
  2. Selects a patient profile from the list.
  3. Taps the voice recording button and speaks.
  4. AI transcribes speech in real time and immediately saves the structured chart entry to the system.
  5. The entry is marked as pending review for later edits by the nurse or a supervisor.

  1.  Nurse logs into the VChart web app.
  2.  Navigates to the “Pending Review” chart entries.
  3.  Selects a patient chart to review.
  4.  Reads the AI-generated chart entry.
  5.  Makes quick edits if necessary.
