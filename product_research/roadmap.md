# Roadmap

As we move forward with developing our AI-powered EMR system, our strategic roadmap outlines key milestones across three phases: short-term (MVP development), medium-term (feature expansion and compliance research), and long-term (market readiness and full-scale deployment). Our primary goal is to build an intuitive, AI-driven solution that enhances efficiency for nurses and doctors while ensuring security and compliance.

This roadmap details the critical steps required to achieve our vision, from setting up core infrastructure and AI-powered charting to integrating with existing hospital systems and securing funding for long-term growth. By following this structured plan, we aim to deliver a cutting-edge EMR solution that streamlines documentation, reduces administrative burden, and improves healthcare outcomes.
